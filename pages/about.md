Based on everyday experience, we gain better understanding of certain concepts and some times get new ideas/approaches to address some commonly required use cases. It may be in the field of technology or functioning of a business process or simply any topic of personal interest. But most often these thoughts are lost, if they are not documented on a regular basis or not implemented.

So this website is a central place to record my understandings on topics of interest and also to share with others of similar interests. This also provides an opportunity for me to get feedback and learn from others having better knowledge/experience. You can contact me on [GitHub](https://github.com/prashantbhat/prashantbhat.github.io/issues/new).

### Blog on Accounting, Programming and other interests.

Professionals and Small/Medium Businesses make lot of financial transactions which need to be accounted for reporting and statistical analysis. As Business operations continue to expand and grow, there is a greater need for system solutions to record those activities and standardization of business processes, in order to focus more on their core expertise. With the growing technology adoption in market place, providing customers access to their own data and related services, has become a necessity.

Building such a solution for managing personal finances, also addressing requirements of Professional Service providers and Small Businesses, has been of great interest to me. This also enables me to work with latest technologies and improve my understanding of common business processes.

So my blogs will focus on topics related to accounting and associated features as well as on programming to develop such solutions.
