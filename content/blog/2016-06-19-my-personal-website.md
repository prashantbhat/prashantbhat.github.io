Based on everyday experience, we gain better understanding of certain concepts and some times get new ideas/approaches to address some commonly required use cases. It may be in the field of technology or functioning of a business process or simply any topic of personal interest. But most often these thoughts are lost, if they are not documented on a regular basis or not implemented.
<br/><br/>
So this website is a central place to record my understandings on topics of interest and also to share with others of similar interests. This also provides an opportunity for me to get feedback and learn from others having better knowledge/experience.

### Building and Hosting of this website

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and [Lanyon Plus](https://github.com/dyndna/lanyon-plus.git) theme. It is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Following is a short description of these:

* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) are public webpages hosted and published from a GitHub repository. Jekyll [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages) explains it as:

  > GitHub Pages are public web pages for users, organizations, and repositories, that are freely hosted on GitHub's github.io domain or on a custom domain name of your choice. GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll behind the scenes, so in addition to supporting regular HTML content, they're also a great way to host your Jekyll-powered website for free.

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

* [Lanyon Plus](https://github.com/dyndna/lanyon-plus.git): Based on lanyon - is a content-first, sliding sidebar theme for Jekyll.

### Why GitHub and Jekyll

There are many free sites available for publishing blogs like Wordpress, Blogger, etc. But GitHub Pages provide a simple approach for creating & hosting the content and ability to test it offline. It is also a natural choice as my projects are hosted on GitHub.

Many have shared their experience and reasons for moving to GitHib Pages, below are few samples:

* [Moving from Wordpress to Github Pages](http://perfectionkills.com/moving-from-wordpress-to-github-pages) lists following advantages:

  >* Simple and familiar workflow via Git & Github
   * Quick and easy updates (takes few seconds to change, commit, push)
   * Can add/update content while offline (thanks to Git, of course)
   * Simple formatting via Markdown or HTML (know exactly how text will be formatted and displayed)

* [Bye bye Wordpress, welcome Github pages](http://tostring.it/2014/05/21/bye-bye-wordpress-welcome-github-pages) mentions not requiring server side code as the most important advantage, in addition to Performance, simplicity of Hosting, Maintenance etc.

### Final thoughts

Documenting any idea properly, requires much greater analysis and logically well organized presentation. A persistent effort is needed and more time should be allocated as well. I understand it to be a difficult task but still hope to put efforts and make it a regular practice.
